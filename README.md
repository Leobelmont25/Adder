# Adder
Implementation of a VHDL adder to test a complete digital flow using open-source tools. The project is developed in a WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) environment and covers both high-level simulation (GHDL + GTKWave) and physical synthesis (OpenLane) of the circuit.

# Defining Actions

I - The first step is to test the design of a classic full adder, described in VHDL, using the GHDL simulator. This step allows the functional behavior of the circuit to be verified through simulations. After the simulation, the resulting waveforms are visualized with GTKWave, which allows a detailed analysis of the logical operation of the adder;

II - With the functionality of the adder verified, the next step is to convert the VHDL code to a Verilog equivalent. This conversion is essential to enable integration with the OpenLANE backend flow, which primarily operates with projects written in Verilog. The generated Verilog file will serve as input for the physical implementation step;

III - Using the Verilog code generated in the previous step, the back-end flow begins using OpenLANE, an open-source toolkit for the physical implementation of ASICs. The flow comprises several steps, including logic synthesis, floorplanning, placement, routing, and generation of final files, such as .gds, which represents the complete physical layout of the chip. At the end of this step, a layout is obtained that is ready to be sent to manufacturing or for additional physical verification;

IV - Finally, the entire project structure, including code files, automation scripts, simulation results, and files generated by the OpenLANE flow, is organized and documented in a repository. The documentation describes the steps taken, tools used, instructions for use, and results obtained, serving as a guide for reproducibility and learning by other users interested in the complete digital design flow using open-source tools.

# Simulations

# 1. VHDL Adder - Simulation and Verification using GHDL + GTKWave

This project demonstrates the simulation and verification of a VHDL adder using open-source tools such as **GHDL** and **GTKWave**. Below are described the steps to perform the analysis, simulation and visualization of the waveforms.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisite

- The project was developed using WSL and IIC-OSIC tools. Available (https://github.com/iic-jku/IIC-OSIC-TOOLS)

Make sure you have the following tools installed in your environment (preferably via WSL):

- [GHDL](https://ghdl.readthedocs.io)
- [GTKWave](http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net)

---

## üìÅ Project Structure

Run the following commands to analyze the VHDL source files:

```bash

ghdl -a full_adder.vhdl
ghdl -a adder.vhdl

// Testbenches Analysis
ghdl -a full_adder_tb.vhdl
ghdl -a adder_tb.vhdl

// Preparation of Test Units
ghdl -e full_adder_tb
ghdl -e adder_tb

// Running Simulations and Generating Waveforms
ghdl -r full_adder_tb --wave=full_adder_tb.ghw
ghdl -r adder_tb --wave=adder_tb.ghw

```
# Viewing Waveforms

Open the .ghw files in GTKWave to inspect the simulated signals:
```bash

gtkwave ./waves/full_adder_tb.ghw
gtkwave ./waves/adder_tb.ghw

## üìã Requirements

- [Yosys](https://yosyshq.net/yosys/)
- [GHDL](https://ghdl.github.io/ghdl/)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Procedures

### üîπ full_adder

```bash
yosys -m ghdl -p 'ghdl full_adder.vhdl -e full_adder; write_verilog full_adder.v'
````
### üîπ adder

```bash
yosys -m ghdl -p 'ghdl adder.vhdl -e full_adder; write_verilog adder.v'
````
Projects in OpenLane have configuration files. A configuration file contains user-defined values ‚Äã‚Äãfor various openlane.config.Variable parameters. With them, you control the flows. The configuration file of the adder project is config.json.
In addition, you need to provide the pin ordering, available in the order_pin.cfg file.

# 3. Checking Results in OpenLane
## Verilog >> GDSII

This document describes the process of transforming a Verilog design into a physical layout in GDSII format using the OpenLANE platform.

---

## üìã Requirements

- [OpenLANE](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Procedures

1. Make sure that the OpenLANE environment is correctly installed and configured.
2. Copy the generated Verilog file (`.v`) to the OpenLANE design structure.
3. Configure the project by adjusting the necessary parameters in the OpenLANE configuration files.
4. Run the synthesis and physical implementation flow using the standard script:

```bash
openlane config.json
openlane --last-run --flow openinopenroad config.json

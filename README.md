# Adder
Implementation of a VHDL adder to test a complete digital flow using open-source tools. The project is developed in a WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) environment and covers both high-level simulation (GHDL + GTKWave) and physical synthesis (OpenLane) of the circuit.

# Defining Actions

I - The first step is to test the design of a classic full adder, described in VHDL, using the GHDL simulator. This step allows the functional behavior of the circuit to be verified through simulations. After the simulation, the resulting waveforms are visualized with GTKWave, which allows a detailed analysis of the logical operation of the adder;

II - With the functionality of the adder verified, the next step is to convert the VHDL code to a Verilog equivalent. This conversion is essential to enable integration with the OpenLANE backend flow, which primarily operates with projects written in Verilog. The generated Verilog file will serve as input for the physical implementation step.

III - Using the Verilog code generated in the previous step, the back-end flow begins using OpenLANE, an open-source toolkit for the physical implementation of ASICs. The flow comprises several steps, including logic synthesis, floorplanning, placement, routing, and generation of final files, such as .gds, which represents the complete physical layout of the chip. At the end of this step, a layout is obtained that is ready to be sent to manufacturing or for additional physical verification.

IV - Finally, the entire project structure, including code files, automation scripts, simulation results, and files generated by the OpenLANE flow, is organized and documented in a repository. The documentation describes the steps taken, tools used, instructions for use, and results obtained, serving as a guide for reproducibility and learning by other users interested in the complete digital design flow using open-source tools.
